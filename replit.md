# Legal Document Analysis Platform

## Overview

This is a full-stack legal document analysis application built with React/TypeScript frontend and Express.js backend. The platform allows users to upload legal documents, get AI-powered analysis, and perform intelligent queries on document content. The application uses modern web technologies including React Query for state management, shadcn/ui for components, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for data persistence.

**Migration Status**: Successfully migrated from Lovable to Replit on July 13, 2025. All core functionality is working including file uploads, job processing, document analysis, and AI-powered proposal classification.
